# Network Analytics and Automation Project

## Overview
This project is a network performance analytics and reporting system built using **AlmaLinux 9.5**, **Minikube**, and **AWX**. It automates the collection of network metrics like latency, download speed, and uptime, generating a daily report that is emailed to a specified recipient.

### Features
- Automates network metric collection:
  - **Latency** (in milliseconds)
  - **Download Speed** (in Mbps)
  - **Uptime** (in hours)
- Generates a professional PDF report with:
  - Visualized graphs (line charts) comparing metrics against home averages.
  - Summary section with metric highlights.
- Sends the report via email to a configured recipient.
- Securely handles sensitive credentials (email addresses and app passwords) using **Ansible Vault**.

## Requirements
### System Requirements
- **AlmaLinux 9.5**
- **Docker** and **Minikube** for Kubernetes containerization
- **AWX** for job automation
- **Git** for version control

### Software Dependencies
- Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `fpdf2`
- DejaVu and Noto Color Emoji fonts (for emojis in the report)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image
Use Minikube's local Docker environment to build the custom AWX Execution Environment:
```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t custom-awx-ee:latest .
```

### 3. Configure AWX
1. Import the playbook into AWX from this repository.
2. Add the following **AWX credentials**:
   - Email username and recipient.
   - App password for the email service.
3. Set up **Ansible Vault** for storing sensitive credentials:
   - Encrypt credentials with the `ansible-vault` command.
   - Reference the encrypted variables in the playbook.

### 4. Run the Job
1. Launch the AWX job template for the playbook.
2. The job will:
   - Collect network metrics.
   - Generate a PDF report.
   - Email the report to the recipient.

## Security Considerations
1. Use **Ansible Vault** to encrypt sensitive variables like email credentials.
2. Avoid committing plaintext credentials or sensitive information to public repositories.
